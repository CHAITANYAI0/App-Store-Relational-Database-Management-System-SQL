# 📱 App Store Management System

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **App Store Management System** is a comprehensive solution designed to manage applications across various platforms efficiently. The App Store categorizes applications based on genres such as Art & Design, Social Media, E-Books, Entertainment, Finance, Food & Drinks, Health & Fitness, Maps, and more. It provides users with an intuitive interface to install, uninstall, and update applications, as well as to provide reviews and ratings. Companies can also use this interface to launch their applications and gather user feedback.

## 🌐 Background
In the digital era, the smartphone industry is rapidly growing, transforming how we live, communicate, work, shop, travel, and entertain ourselves. The App Store is a personalized hub that simplifies these aspects by providing a platform where users can access various applications tailored to their needs. For companies, it offers an opportunity to reach a broad audience by developing and distributing software applications.

## 🎯 Mission Statement/Objectives
The App Store Management Database System aims to serve as a centralized, robust, and efficient system where applications are integrated seamlessly from both a user's and a company's perspective. Key objectives include:
- **User Accessibility**: Enable users to easily find, install, and manage applications.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to review and rate applications, providing valuable feedback to developers.
- **Company Integration**: Provide companies with tools to upload, update, and manage their applications, and access user feedback.

## 📊 Database Design

### Entity-Relationship Diagram
The ER diagram provides a visual representation of the database structure and relationships between entities. Significant modifications include:
- **User App Catalogue**: Now an associative entity linking App and Profile.
- **Card Details**: Normalized into `Name_on_card` and `CVV`.
- **User Information**: Address split into `Street Name`, `Apt_Number`, `Zip_Code`, `State`, and `Country`.
- **Advertiser and Developer**: Advertisement is now a strong entity, removing the "Advertises" relationship.
- **App and Reviews**: Ratings removed from the App entity to avoid redundancy.
- **App**: Attribute `age` renamed to `Release_date`.
